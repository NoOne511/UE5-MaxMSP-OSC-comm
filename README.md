# UE5-MaxMSP-OSC-comm
 OSC communication between Unreal Engine and Max/MSP: raw data exchange, 3D granulator construction, player position and camera rotation.

This project has been created with Unreal Engine 5.3.2 (it has not been tested with previous or successive versions) and 
Max 8.6.2 (previous and later versions may work fine).

In UE5 check if the OSC plugin is activated in Edit -> Plugins -> search "OSC" in all plugins and activate "OSC (Open Sound Control)". Restart UE5.
Open the level "OSCcomm" from All/Content/Levels.

> From Max/MSP package manager:
>  - odot by CNMAT
>  - MuBu for Max
